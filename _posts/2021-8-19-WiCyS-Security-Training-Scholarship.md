During year 2021, I was selected as one of the recipients of WiCyS Security Training Scholarship. This is a multi-stage training program for cybersecurity fully funded by Google, Facebook, and Bloomberg at the SANS Institute. Here, I would like to put together an article to record my experience as I work through this program.

## Initial Application
To get into this program, an application with application essay is needed. I first submitted the general initial application around the end of July which was very close to the deadline, Angus 2nd. I was doing a lot of other work besides this, so I didnâ€™t think about it much. I thought at the very least, I could make it into the beginning CTF. Not very many days later, I got the invitation to the beginning CTF. 

## Stage I: Beginner CTF
It was not very hard to get into the beginning CTF. I think all qualified applicants are invited to this CTF, and around 900 people received the invitation. Then, around 600 people joined and played.

This CTF was held from August 6th 12pm to August 9th 9am. It was a weekend where I started working on Friday noon and ended on Sunday night. As my first CTF, I was very excited. I promised myself I would try very hard and I did. Questions in this CTF include web attack, cryptography, forensics, networking, and steganography. I am originally really good at programing and websites, so all the questions related to Python, Javascript, or SQL injection did not beat me. Networking and cryptography are not very hard for me either. However, my vulnerabilities are in forensics and steganography. These two topics are something I have never touched before. Especially there was one question which combined both forensics and steganography together, and it tricked so many of us. But I eventually finished all questions and got a high score on the leaderboard. 

After all, this CTF is such a fun experience and pushed my limits so far. I was having doubts whether I am able to finished all the questions when I first started, but right now I am just proud of myself on finishing it. When we finished the CTF, the true waiting game began. There are going to be 250 people getting selected to the next stage. I am usually not a person gets nervous, but all the messages I got during the day results coming out made me truly nervous a little bit.

## Stage II: Cyberstart Game
Monday August 16th is the day results coming out, and I got the email indicates that I successfully made it into stage two. Stage two will start on August 23rd, and this is a stage we go through SANS Cyberstart Game for three months.
