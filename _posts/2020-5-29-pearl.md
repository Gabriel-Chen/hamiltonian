I am a bird flying through mountains in Los Banos

Sunlights paint shadows into beige

Through waving grass shining in gold

Mountains walk into me like a painting by CÃ©zanne

<br>

Trees trickle in the wind

The wind blooms flowers on my face

Growing as circles in a desert

Bushes are in the shape of pearls on your neck

<br>

Someone pulled the string out

And your neck is too delicate to hold all these heavy pearls

They fall out from heaven

With the milky scent on your skin

Then all mountains are blessed by you

Only you
