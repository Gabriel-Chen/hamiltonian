		I know why you're here. 
		</p>
		<p>
		I know what you've been doing. 
		</p>
		<p>
		I know why you hardly sleep, and why night after night you sit at your computer. 
		</p>
		<p>
		You're looking for him. 
		</p>
		<p>
		I know, because I was once looking for the same thing. 
		</p>
		<p>
		And when he found me, he told me I wasn't really looking for him, I was looking for an answer. 
		</p>
		<p>
		It's the question that drives us.
		</p>
		<p>
		It's the question that brought you here. 
		</p>
		<p>
		You know the question, just as I did.
