During year 2021, I was selected as one of the recipients of WiCyS Security Training Scholarship. This is a multi-stage training program for people who pursue careers in cybersecurity fully funded by Google, Facebook (now Meta), and Bloomberg at the SANS Institute. Here, I would like to put together an article to record my experience as I work through this program.

## Initial Application

To get into this program, an application with an application essay is needed. I submitted the general initial application around the end of July which was very close to the deadline, Angus 2nd. I was doing a lot of other work besides this, so I didn’t think about it much. I thought at the very least, I could make it into the beginning CTF. Not very many days later, I got the invitation to the beginning CTF.

## Stage I: Beginner CTF

It was not very hard to get into the beginning CTF. I think all qualified applicants regardless other criteria are invited to this CTF. In this stage, around 900 people received the invitation. Then, around 600 people joined and played.

This CTF was held from August 6th 12pm to August 9th 9am. It was a weekend where I started working on Friday noon and ended it on Sunday night. As my first CTF, I was very excited. I promised myself I would try very hard and I did. Questions in this CTF include web attack, cryptography, forensics, networking, and steganography. I am originally really good at programing and websites, so all the questions related to Python, Javascript, database, or injection did not beat me. Networking and cryptography are not very hard for me eitherd. However, my vulnerabilities are in forensics and steganography. These two topics are something I have never touched before. Especially for one question which combines forensics and steganography together, it tricked not only me but also many of us. Eventually, I finished all questions and got a high score on the leaderboard.

After all, this CTF is such a fun experience and pushed my limits so far. I was having doubts whether I am able to finished all questions at all when I first started, but right now I am just proud of myself on finishing it. When we finished the CTF, the true waiting game began. There will be 250 people getting selected to the next stage. I am usually not a person gets nervous, but all messages I got in our Slack and Discord channels during the day results coming out made me truly nervous a little bit.

## Stage II: Cyberstart Game

Monday August 16th is the day results coming out, and I got the email indicates that I successfully made it into the stage two. Stage two starts on August 23rd, and this is a stage we go through SANS Cyberstart Game for three months.

The first week is a busy week. Since I am planning on solving questions I know how to solve as soon as possible, I spend a lot of time pushing the progress forward this week. There are four parts in this game, Headquarter Base, Moon Base, Forensic Base, and Volcano Base. Headquarter Base is where everything starts. It has thirteen levels and questions get harder as the levels go up. This is also the base which has the most questions as there are 156 questions in the Headquarter Base. 

The Moon Base is a base for python scripts writing. It is the easiest part for me as an engineer, so I finished this base within the first week. This part of Python learning focus on web scripting and sockets, nothing relates to actual programing with data structures or algorithms though. There are 40 questions in the Moon Base altogether. 

The Forensic Base is the hardest base for me. It combines all knowledge I have gotten from other bases and steganography. I didn't work on this part much as it is so hard and requires a lot of disk space to analyze huge data dumps.This base has 40 question in total. 

For the Volcano Base, it is unlocked once the Headquarter Base is finished. I didn't got that far this time.

After more than a month of work on the Cyberstart Game, I have finished as much as I could. So far at the ending point of the stage two, the working progress for me is 83%. It is not a bad progress, and I am glad that I have solved so many questions which were not quite solvable for me in the beginning of this training program. However, my feeling for this stage is mixed. Personally, I think this stage is not quite a “training” stage even through people are posting that they have learned so much through this game. I would say this is a follow up stage of the CTF from the stage one. This is still a CTF, but much bigger and longer. Basically, I barely able to solve a problem if I don’t know the knowledge I should have known, which is the way it is supposed to be regarding knowledge. In this case, I don’t even know the existence of such knowledge. So, I would say this is not a training stage, but a competition stage.

## Stage III - CyberGen IQ Test

After finishing the stage ii, I got an email invites me to stage iii right after. Before this email, I met someone who was in the program last year and learned the stage iii last year was a CompCIA format exam. However, it is different this year. This year, the stage iii is an IQ test, which is very interesting. It is called [Cyber.IQ](http://cyber.iq/) developed by HayStack. It has 14 sections which evaluates one’s cybersecurity abilities throughout different IQ tests. These tests include pattern recognition, memorization, cognitive closure, and etc.

To be honest, I don’t quite like this test. There are couple of reasons for this. First of all, I don’t like judging people or being judge by people based on things we have no control by ourselves. Everyone has a standard, and each standard is so different which makes the evaluation process of who is suitable for what certain career full of bias. Who has the rights to say who is able to do anything? Well, women were thought to be not suitable in engineer field back to not many years ago. Secondly, the result of these kind of tests can easily be manipulated. For example, I can easily lie that I like open problems, and there is not a machine which can detect my lies. So, I don’t see a point of taking these kind of tests. Third but not last, specifically for this IQ test we took, there is no proctor nor a lock down browser during the test. I can easily exploit the JavaScript run by this test. The worst part is it lets you take a test multiple times. Although it was announced that only the first attempt counts, it is not hard at all to bypass this rule.

Besides personal opinions mentioned above, there are many bugs in this test. The JavaScript used in this test does not run in many browsers, the clock does not work properly for timed questions and can be easily manipulated, and sometimes (maybe many times from what I saw in slack channels) the result does not record itself. This is a very new tool which is not quite good enough to be used. I hope all these bugs can be at least fixed before using this test on any recruiting events. If I got this kind of buggy test while interviewing with anywhere, this place is going to be on my blacklist for a long time.

## Stage IV - SANS SEC275 + GFACT Certification Exam

After finishing up stage iii, I was selected as the final 40 recipient of the scholarship to continue the stage iv. This is where the true training begins (I hope). We are going to work on SANS 275 the foundation of security training course, and we are going to take the GFACT certification exam upon finish.

The preparation phase starts officially on the first day of November, and the last day to take the exam is the last day of December. This is a very fast pace phase in general, but I believe whoever is able to make it to this point can finish this phase without too much trouble. There are three books for this course which are shipped to me at the end of October. There is also an online pre-recored course provided. The material is fine to learn and read. If you have already finished a Computer Science undergraduate degree as I have, you won’t have to learn much from these books but only the part of penetration procedures in book 3.

For the final exam, there are two formats to take the it, one is through a testing center, and another is online proctoring. This choice is debatable since a lot of people hate online proctoring. However, most testing centers do not have tables big enough for both the computer and all the books you would need. Also, because of the Covid situation, I chose to take it online at my place. One of the good things for taking a SANS exam is that it is open books and open notes. So, prepare to have a table big enough to spread everything while the exam. There are many online preparation guides suggest that one should index the books for a quicker reference during the exam, but I didn’t index my book. There is an index for each book, and that is enough for me while referencing the books.

The passing bar for GFACT is 71%. This bar is not high at all, and anyone actually works though all books are able to pass it. After successfully finish the GFACT exam, if you score higher than 90%, you would be invited to join the SANS advisory board. This is a mailing list very worth joining. It has discussions among security professionals and researchers, job opportunities, and even SANS certificates exams give away. Regardless the final score, you may also participate the SANS Gold Paper for GFACT. This is where you write and publish a peer-reviewed research paper based on any topic covered in GFACT.

At the end of year 2021, I passed the GFACT certificate exam and am ready for the next stage. The GFACT is a foundational certificate which is not too hard to pass. I scored higher than 90% and successfully joined the advisory board.

## Stage V - SANS SEC401 + GSEC Certification

This stage is the major stage for this whole training program, and GSEC certification is essential for security related research or jobs. 

After getting seven books for this certificate and learning the exam lasts four hours, I realized why this course is one of the hardest test in SANS training. The first thing I did is making a detailed plan with how much work I have to finish for each week in order to get everything done on time. Roughly speaking, we only have one and a half month to finish this certificate up. This is an extremely tight schedule. In the mean time, I have work, school, and life going on. 

The major thing I did during this stage is reading and understanding the book. Question for GSEC are much more comprehensive than GFACT, and one has to really understand the concept to pass the certificate. Besides books, there is a lab portion for GSEC, which means the test taker has to do a live exploitation through the exam. For the lab, there is a whole book provided and two virtual machine images for us to practice.

Overall, the pace for this stage is quite fast. We only got roughly a month and a half to prepare and finish the certificate attempt. Luckily, each of us got one extension throughout the whole scholarship, so many of us used that extension on GSEC. However, after a two months of intensive study, I decided to finish this up without using the extension. I am very glad that I passed the GSEC  on time.

The whole exam lasts four hours and is very hard to manage the time if you don't have a time table. Usually, my exams last at most for two hours, and this is the first time for me taking a four hours exam. I underestimated how hard it is to manage such a long time slot and ended up running out of the time. This, a tame table to reference how much time is left on a certain question is extremely needed.

## Stage VI - SANS 530 + GDSA Certificate
