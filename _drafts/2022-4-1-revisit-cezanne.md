It has been a long time since the last time I ever stared at a Cezanne for a long period of time. The last time was when I was still at Berkeley, and I had to finish a composition analysis on Cezanne's work of nature. I came pass several Cezanne's work several times at Pasadena, but never got the chance to sit down and look into it. Recall that time, I stared at one of Cezanne's painting with huge rocks in front of trees for too long, and the security was there waiting for me to leave. That was the time paintings were still displayed without a protecting glass on top, and he probably was getting ready to stop me whenever I try to use my fingers to touch the painting. I have to admit, I got too close and my nose almost touched the huge rock in front of Cezanne's typical shaking trees. 

Cezanne's paintings of nature have always been fascinating to me. He shares a certain motion of moving in still paintings as Van Gogh did. Among all his work, Cezanne has three major regions clearly divided, humans, still life, and nature. All those are very different especially once his work involves people. Cezanne never resonated with people, and as long as there is people in his painting, that piece spreads a sense of rotting inside. However, his work in nature is so lively and fresh. You can feel the sunlight spots shining through tree leaves, and the shaking sounds made by wind flowing through threes and grass. 

## The Horror with Cezanne's People

Like many other painters, Cezanne started painting portraits with people siting in studio. He does not paint realistic well as he is able to feel a lot of details of colors and motions. The process of transforming reality to a still painting, which is also from 3D to 2D, confuses Cezanne. During his early portraits, he could not paint "details" as we usually see in pre-renaissance painting. Instead, there is a sense of motion among the background of this portrait. Cezanne is able to feel the flow in the air and catch it in his painting. This brings the background of this portrait even livelier than the human being in the center of this painting. There is no need to mention the messy hands he put here.

Then Cezanne switched from people inside the studio to the outside within nature. However, this helped only a little. He painted all his people in nature from his imagination, and people are not really in good shape in his imagination. Whenever there are people within nature, it seems like the gravity suddenly disappeared and people are slipping out of the painting. The whole composition is also off with a lack of focus whenever Cezanne starts to add people in his paintings with nature.

It got better after years but not much.
